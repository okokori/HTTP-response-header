# Http Response Header Check 

## Description 
This project is an HTTP security headers scanner created to evaluate the security of web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities. The project can check the security status of websites by examining the response headers of HTTP requests made to a specific URL or IP address.

HTTP security headers are important components used to increase the security of web applications and protect against various web attacks. These headers are additional information transmitted by the server to browsers in order to increase the security of web applications and reduce potential security risks. By analysing these security headers, our project helps you evaluate how secure websites are.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to receive responses to HTTP requests sent and print the headers received from the incoming response to the screen. Our project allows users to quickly and easily examine the security headers of a website. It also provides a useful tool for security experts and developers evaluating the security of web applications.

The project has the following basic functionalities:
- Lists the response headers of an HTTP request to a specific URL or IP address.
- It can perform a customised check of user-specified HTTP headers.
- Provides information about HTTP security headers and missing headers.

This project is useful for anyone who wants to improve the security of web applications and detect potential vulnerabilities. HTTP security headers are used to increase the security of web applications and protect against various web attacks.
